In the forgotten corners of the realm, where whispers of ancient lore met the chilling winds that swept through desolate landscapes, there existed a tale shrouded in shadows, bound by fate's capricious threads.

Atop a craggy hill, cloaked in mist and haunted by the mournful cries of ravens, stood the imposing keep of House Eldermore. A noble family, once renowned for their valor and alliances, now languished in the grip of a bitter feud that spanned generations.

Amidst the turmoil, young Ser Aldric Eldermore, heir to the embattled house, bore the weight of legacy upon his shoulders. His father, Lord Aric, a stern man with eyes like flint, ruled with an iron grip, haunted by secrets buried within the family's history.

Ser Aldric, a man of unwavering resolve and a heart burdened by duty, sought to mend the fractures that splintered his family. Yet, amidst the labyrinthine halls of the keep, whispers of betrayal and ancient curses lingered like phantoms.

One fateful eve, as the moon hung low, casting silvery tendrils upon the weathered stones of the castle, a shadowy figure emerged from the depths of the Eldermore crypts. A figure cloaked in tattered robes and wielding a cryptic tome—the key to unlocking a dormant power that lay veiled in darkness.

The figure, a specter from ages past, whispered forbidden incantations that stirred the dormant energies lurking within the castle's walls. Ancient wards shattered, and an otherworldly miasma seeped into the keep, twisting reality and awakening long-forgotten terrors.

As chaos unfurled within the Eldermore keep, Ser Aldric rallied his loyal companions—a stalwart knight, a cunning mage, and a rogue with a penchant for secrets—forging an unlikely fellowship to confront the encroaching darkness.

Their quest led them through treacherous corridors where shadows writhed and spectral whispers echoed. Battles against malevolent forces tested their mettle, and the line between ally and foe blurred amidst the chaos.

In the heart of the crypts, where ancient secrets lay entombed, Ser Aldric faced the specter, wielding not steel but the strength of his resolve. With the tome clasped tightly, he uttered a resounding incantation, a prayer for salvation woven from the threads of valor and sacrifice.

A blinding burst of light rent the veil of darkness, banishing the malevolent presence that threatened to consume the keep. Ser Aldric, bloodied and battered, emerged victorious, the curse broken, and the Eldermore legacy forever altered.

As dawn's light kissed the horizon, Ser Aldric stood amidst the ruins, his eyes fixed upon a new horizon, where hope mingled with the remnants of a shattered past. The tale of House Eldermore, entwined with peril and redemption, echoed through the annals of time, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit amidst the darkest of trials.

In the smoky halls of the Ironkeep, the air was thick with tension. Lord Torran Greyfyre, a man whose name echoed through the realms like a curse, stood at the high table, his shadow long against the firelit walls. His steel-grey eyes glimmered beneath his helm, the weight of his iron crown pressing heavily on his brow. The feast before him was untouched.

At the far end of the hall, his bannermen, knights, and lords whispered, their voices barely rising above the crackling hearth. They spoke of rumors that spread faster than wildfire—a rebellion to the north, led by those who had once sworn fealty to him. Torran knew rebellion well, for he had carved his path to power through it. But this was different. This threat came not from his enemies, but from within his own bloodline.

He gripped the hilt of his sword, Coldbane, and felt the familiar chill seep through his gauntlet. It was said to be forged from the black ice of the Bitter Peaks, a blade that had taken the lives of kings and traitors alike. Tonight, it would take another life, should the need arise.

The hall fell silent as the great oaken doors groaned open. A lone figure entered, cloaked in furs, his steps quiet but deliberate. It was Merek, Torran’s eldest son, his hair as dark as the storm clouds that gathered over the sea. Behind him trailed two of his sworn guards, their faces grim beneath their helms.

“Merek,” Torran said, his voice as cold as the blade he wielded. “You've kept us waiting.”

Merek bowed, but his eyes never left his father’s. “The winds are treacherous, Father. I had no choice but to travel cautiously.”

“The winds have never stopped you before,” Torran replied, leaning forward. “What news do you bring from the North?”

Merek hesitated, his jaw tight. “The North rises, as you feared. They march under the banners of the White Tree. They call you a tyrant, an oathbreaker. And they are not alone.”

Torran’s gaze darkened. “Who stands with them?”

“The Darnells. The Stormlords. Even House Redwyne,” Merek said, his voice steady despite the weight of the words. “And more will join once the blood is spilled.”

Torran let out a low chuckle. “Let them come. They will break upon the walls of Ironkeep like waves upon the rocks. I have defeated worse.”

“But they are not the worst of it, Father,” Merek continued, his voice quieter now. “The banners of the Griffon have been seen among them.”

Torran’s hand tightened around Coldbane’s hilt, his knuckles white. The Griffon—a sigil as ancient as the Greyfyres themselves. House Talandar, a family bound to his own by blood and marriage. For years, they had been loyal. For years, they had stood at his side, through wars and feasts, through betrayals and victories. But if they had joined the rebellion, it meant one thing: treachery ran deeper than Torran had ever imagined.

“And who leads them?” Torran asked, though he feared he already knew the answer.

Merek’s silence was all the confirmation Torran needed.

“Your brother,” Merek finally said. “Joran. He leads them.”

For a long moment, the hall was silent, save for the crackling of the fire. The lords at the table shifted uneasily, their eyes darting between father and son. Torran could feel their doubt, their fear, hanging in the air like smoke.

Joran. The second son. The one with fire in his blood and ambition in his heart. Torran had always known this day might come, but he had hoped it would not be so soon.

“Then it is settled,” Torran said, standing slowly. His voice rang out, a cold and steady declaration. “We march at dawn.”

Merek’s eyes flickered. “Father, there is still time to talk, to parley—”

“Parley?” Torran’s voice was a snarl. “There is no parley with traitors. Joran has made his choice, and now he will reap what he has sown.”

Merek stepped closer, lowering his voice. “He is still your son, Father.”

Torran met his gaze, his eyes hard as iron. “He was my son. Now, he is my enemy.”

With that, Torran turned and strode from the hall, his cloak billowing behind him like a shadow. The lords followed in his wake, their murmurs hushed, their faces pale. Merek stood alone, watching his father disappear into the gloom.

In the quiet of the hall, Merek felt the weight of the coming storm settle over him like a cloak of ice. Blood would be spilled, and when the sun rose again, the world would be forever changed.

But in the game of thrones, change was the only certainty.

And the dead did not weep for what was lost.

The winter winds howled through the narrow pass of Frosthall, the sound like the wail of long-dead kings. Lord Aldric Stormborn stood at the edge of the battlements, his furs drawn tight against the biting cold, his breath curling like smoke in the frozen air. Below him, his army waited—men clad in steel and leather, their banners snapping in the wind, the sigil of the stormbird emblazoned upon them.

They had marched for weeks, braving the snow-choked roads and the treacherous paths through the mountains, but now they had reached their destination. The gates of Winterfall loomed ahead, dark and unyielding, the stronghold of House Coldwater. Aldric’s jaw clenched as he gazed at the castle. It was a fortress built of ice and stone, impenetrable, they said. But no castle was impenetrable. Not with the right kind of fire.

"My lord," a voice said behind him, and Aldric turned to see Ser Edric Snow, his bastard cousin, approach. Edric’s face was hard, his blue eyes sharp, but there was a flicker of doubt in them, a rare sight in the man who had fought beside Aldric for years.

"They’re expecting us," Edric said, nodding toward the castle. "We’ve lost the element of surprise."

Aldric grunted. "I never expected a surprise to win this battle. Coldwater knows we’re coming, but they don’t know what we bring."

Edric glanced at the dark shapes moving in the shadows beyond the army’s camp, the massive figures chained and muzzled, their breath steaming in the cold. "Are you certain?" he asked quietly. "The beasts—"

"Are our only chance," Aldric finished, his voice sharp. "The Coldwaters have held these lands for centuries. Their walls have never fallen, not to sword or siege. But I have something they don’t. I have dragons."

Edric’s jaw tightened. "They’re not dragons, Aldric. They’re wyrms. And they’re not tamed."

"They will be," Aldric said, though he wasn’t entirely sure of it. The wyrms were creatures from the deep places of the world, older than man, older even than dragons. Unlike their fiery cousins, these beasts did not breathe flame. They brought frost and shadow, their scales like black ice, their eyes cold as the void. And they were hungry.

Aldric turned back to the castle. His fingers traced the hilt of his sword, Stormbreaker, a blade forged in the old ways, with runes etched along its length. It was said to be unbreakable, as long as its wielder’s heart was true. But hearts had a way of faltering in the cold.

"Have the men ready," Aldric commanded. "We attack at dawn."

Edric hesitated. "The men—some of them have seen the wyrms. They’re afraid, Aldric. They think you’ve brought demons from the Abyss to fight this war."

Aldric’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Let them think what they want. Fear is a weapon, Edric. And we’ll need every weapon we can muster if we’re to bring down Winterfall."

Edric nodded, though there was still doubt in his eyes. "And when the battle is done? What then?"

Aldric’s gaze darkened. "Then we take the North."

"And the Coldwaters?"

Aldric’s expression grew colder still. "I made a promise to my father. House Coldwater will pay for what they’ve done."

Edric was silent for a moment. "And Lady Sera? She’s still your wife."

Aldric’s hand tightened on the hilt of Stormbreaker. Sera. The thought of her name was like a blade twisting in his chest. She had once been his greatest ally, the love of his life. But now, she was his greatest betrayal. She had chosen her family, her blood, over him. She had warned the Coldwaters of his plans, sent word of his coming before he even crossed the mountains.

"She made her choice," Aldric said quietly. "She chose them."

"And you will kill her?"

Aldric’s eyes were cold as the night. "I will do what must be done."

He turned away before Edric could say more, before the doubt in his cousin’s eyes could infect his own resolve. He descended the steps from the battlements and strode through the camp, past the men sharpening their swords and readying their armor. He could feel their eyes on him, some filled with respect, others with fear. But none of them would question him. Not after what they had seen him do.

At the edge of the camp, the wyrms waited. They were chained to massive iron posts, their scales glittering in the moonlight like shards of obsidian. Their eyes followed Aldric as he approached, their breath coming in slow, deep gusts that chilled the air even further. They were creatures of ice and shadow, and Aldric could feel their hunger, their need to be free of their chains.

He stepped closer to the largest of them, a beast nearly the size of a small castle, its black scales slick with frost. Its eyes, pale and cold, locked onto his. For a moment, neither of them moved. Then, slowly, Aldric reached out his hand and placed it on the creature’s snout. The wyrm’s breath came in a long, slow exhale, and for a moment, Aldric thought he could feel the beat of its ancient heart.

"We will have our revenge," Aldric whispered. "We will burn their legacy to the ground."

The wyrm’s eyes flickered, and its tail lashed against the ground. Aldric knew it could kill him in an instant if it wanted to. But it didn’t. The beast could sense the same thing that drove him—the cold rage, the unrelenting fury that would not be sated until Winterfall lay in ruins.

As dawn crept over the horizon, the wyrms stirred, their chains rattling as they rose to their full height. Aldric mounted his horse and rode to the front of his army, the stormbird banner fluttering beside him. His men stood ready, their eyes wide as they beheld the creatures that would lead them into battle.

Aldric raised his sword, the light of the rising sun glinting off the blade.

"To Winterfall!" he shouted. "To vengeance!"

And with a roar, the wyrms surged forward, their icy breath freezing the ground beneath them, their hunger for blood and destruction matching Aldric’s own.

Winterfall would fall, and the Coldwaters would be no more.


The wind howled through the Vale of Blackreach, its mournful wail echoing off the jagged peaks like the cry of a dying god. At the edge of the crumbling cliffs stood Lady Alysanne Draven, her raven-dark hair whipping around her face as she stared out over the fog-shrouded valley below. The sky was a bruised purple, the setting sun casting a blood-red glow over the mountains. Winter was coming to the Vale, and with it, death.

Behind her, the banners of House Draven fluttered in the wind—the black talon on a field of crimson. Her people had always been known for their ferocity, their strength. They were the keepers of the Black Gate, the guardians of the western passes. But even steel could not stop the shadows that now moved in the night.

Alysanne’s grip tightened on the hilt of her sword, Talonfang. The blade had been passed down through generations of Dravens, its edge sharp as the night, its runes glowing faintly in the twilight. She could feel the weight of her ancestors behind her, their cold eyes watching, waiting for her to fail. But she would not fail. Not tonight.

"My lady," a voice rasped from the darkness behind her. Ser Garrick, her sworn sword, approached, his heavy boots crunching on the frost-bitten ground. His face was weathered, his eyes dark hollows beneath the steel of his helm. He had been with her since she was a child, and now, he was one of the few left she could trust.

"They’re close," he said, his voice low. "Scouts have seen them. Less than a day’s march."

Alysanne nodded, her jaw clenched. She had known they would come. The Nightborn. Creatures of darkness, of cold and shadow, their eyes gleaming with the void. They had been little more than legend for centuries—stories whispered by old men and frightened children. But the Nightborn were real, and now they were marching on her lands, an army of the damned, led by a king of ice.

"And my brother?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Garrick hesitated. "Still no word."

Alysanne’s heart tightened in her chest. Her brother, Ryland, had ridden north to seek allies, to rally the lords of the Vale to their cause. But days had turned to weeks, and still there had been no sign of him. She feared the worst, though she dared not voice it. Ryland had always been the hero, the one the people looked to, the shining knight who would save them all. And now, the burden of their fate had fallen to her.

"Prepare the men," Alysanne said, turning away from the cliff’s edge. "We’ll meet them at the pass."

Garrick gave a sharp nod and disappeared into the growing shadows.

Alysanne remained for a moment longer, her eyes fixed on the valley below. The fog twisted and writhed like a living thing, hiding whatever horrors lurked beneath. She had seen the aftermath of a Nightborn raid—villages left in ruin, bodies frozen in the snow, their eyes wide and empty. The Nightborn did not kill like men. They took something more. They took the soul.

Alysanne had always been brave, always been strong. But even she felt a flicker of fear at the thought of what was to come. She had trained for war, but this was not a war of steel and flesh. This was a battle against the darkness itself.

With a final glance at the fading sun, Alysanne turned and descended into the camp below.

The soldiers of Blackreach were a grim lot, seasoned warriors hardened by years of skirmishes along the Vale’s treacherous borders. They looked up as she passed, their eyes reflecting both fear and hope. They trusted her—believed in her. It was a heavy burden to bear.

At the heart of the camp, a massive fire burned, casting long shadows over the gathered men. Ser Garrick was already there, his sword drawn, barking orders to the captains. Alysanne joined him, her face set in stone.

"How many?" she asked.

Garrick grimaced. "Two hundred at most. The rest… they’ve deserted, fled to the mountains."

Alysanne’s lips thinned. She couldn’t blame them. The Nightborn were not an enemy men could fight with swords alone. But that didn’t make their betrayal any easier to swallow.

"Two hundred will have to do," she said coldly.

Garrick glanced at her. "And you, my lady? You’re still certain you’ll fight?"

Alysanne met his gaze. "I was born to fight, Garrick. I will not sit behind these walls and wait for death to find me."

He nodded, respect flickering in his eyes. "Then let’s make sure they remember the name Draven."

The hours passed slowly, the tension in the air thick as the fog creeping through the valley. The soldiers stood ready, their breaths steaming in the cold night air. Alysanne paced along the lines, her armor gleaming faintly in the firelight, her sword strapped to her side. She could feel the eyes of her men on her, could hear their murmurs. They spoke of her father, Lord Alaric, who had held the Vale for thirty years before falling to sickness. They spoke of her brother, Ryland, the golden heir. And they spoke of her—the Lady of Blackreach, who now led them into the mouth of death.

As midnight approached, the fog began to shift. A cold wind swept through the camp, carrying with it a scent of ice and rot. Alysanne’s heart quickened. She could feel it—an unnatural chill creeping up her spine, a darkness pressing in from the edges of the world.

"They’re here," Garrick whispered beside her.

And then she saw them.

At first, they were just shadows moving in the fog, dark shapes slithering through the mist. But as they drew closer, their forms became clearer—tall, gaunt figures, their skin pale as death, their eyes glowing like coals in the night. The Nightborn. Hundreds of them, moving in eerie silence, their black armor reflecting the cold moonlight.

At their head was a figure taller than the rest, clad in armor of black ice, a crown of jagged frost upon his brow. His eyes were cold, ancient, filled with the endless hunger of the void. The Night King. He carried no sword, no weapon, yet the air around him shimmered with cold, as if the very world recoiled from his presence.

Alysanne’s blood ran cold, but she held her ground. She raised her sword high, the blade gleaming with a faint blue light. Talonfang, forged in the heart of a dying star, the last hope of House Draven.

"Hold the line!" she shouted, her voice ringing out over the howling wind. "For Blackreach! For the Vale!"

The Nightborn surged forward, their movements swift and unnatural, like shadows given form. Alysanne’s soldiers braced themselves, their shields locked, their spears leveled.

And then the battle was upon them.

Alysanne fought like a storm unleashed. Her blade danced in the darkness, cutting through the Nightborn with a fierce, desperate grace. The creatures shrieked as Talonfang sliced through their cold flesh, their bodies dissolving into mist as they fell. But for every one that fell, two more seemed to rise from the shadows.

Around her, men screamed and died, their bodies frozen in grotesque contortions, their souls torn from them by the cold hands of the Nightborn. The air was thick with the scent of frost and blood.

Alysanne’s arms ached, her breath coming in ragged gasps, but still she fought. She could feel the eyes of the Night King upon her, watching from the darkness, waiting.

And then, in a moment of terrible clarity, she realized the truth. This was not a battle they could win. This was a slaughter. The Nightborn did not come for the Vale. They came for her.

Alysanne raised her sword, her voice breaking through the chaos.

"To me! Fall back to the keep!"

But even as she spoke, the Night King stepped forward, his eyes locking with hers. In that moment, Alysanne felt the cold touch of despair wrap around her heart. The Night King raised his hand, and the world seemed to freeze.

For a heartbeat, all was still.

And then, darkness fell.

And in the shadows, the last of House Draven was swallowed whole.
